    <description>Displays the chance of a planetarium being present (on the current floor) in the HUD. Takes into account all items, collectibles and modifiers.

[i]Items that affect the chance of a planetarium spawn will not show until you enter the next floor, as your current floor layout will not change.[/i]

Make sure you have the requirements unlocked to be able to actually see the planetarium.

If you continue a previous run, the displayed value may not be correct for the current floor, however will correct itself for the following floor.
